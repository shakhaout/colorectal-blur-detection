# Colorectal-Blur-Detection
This research work proposes a training free no reference image blur detection using Walsh-Hadamard transform and KS-statistic analysis.
We used colonoscopy images as input image and applied image processing technique. Blurriness for colonoscopy images without reference can be detected in real time.
